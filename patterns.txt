Design Patterns Document

Pattern 1: Singleton
  CLI.java: 12, (16-37)
  Justification: The CLI has an instance of itself with a getInstance and a private constructor, ensuring that only one instance of the object can be created.

Pattern 2: Model View Controller
  The whole project

Pattern 3: Factory
  UMLOBject.java, UMLObjectFactory.java, ClassItem.java (239,350), MethodItem.java (81)
  Justification: Decouples the creation of new Method, Field, and Parameter objects from related classes, standardizes getters and setters for type and name
