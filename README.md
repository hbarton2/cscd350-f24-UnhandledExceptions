## About this project
This is a Java-based UML (Unified Modeling Language) editor that supports both a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). This tool allows users to create, edit, and save UML diagrams with ease, making it easy for software developers and designers to visualize their designs. We wanted to create flexibility with our program, so we made it easy to transition from working in the CLI to the GUI and vice versa via save files.
